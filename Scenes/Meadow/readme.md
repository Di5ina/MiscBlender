# Meadow
These two files are for creating a low poly field of grass. The first creates clusters with rotations of 1, 61, and 121 degrees (to prevent z fighting). The second produces single planes that are aligned to the camera. If you're bringing this into an existing scene update the "Rotation target" field to your main scene camera.

# Known Issues
Currently rendering only supports Eevee. Cycles produces really bad results and I'm not sure why. Open to suggestions on how to fix it.
